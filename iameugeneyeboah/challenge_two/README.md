The program allows users to add, view, and delete tasks from a to-do list.
The list of tasks is saved to a file (`todo.txt`)

4. **Persist Data**: The tasks are saved in a file (`todo.txt`)
5. and are reloaded when the program restarts.

2. Ensure Python 3.x is installed.
3. Run the program using a Python interpreter.
