"""
Module for finding the kth largest element in a list.
This module provides a function to find the kth largest element in a list of strings,
where each string represents an integer without leading zeros.

def kth_largest(nums: list, k: int) -> str:
    """
    Return the string that represents the kth largest integer in nums.

    Parameters:
        nums (list): A list of strings where each string represents a positive integer.
        k (int): The position (1-indexed) of the largest element to find.

    Returns:
        str: The string representation of the kth largest integer in the list.

    Raises:
        AssertionError: If the input list is empty, k is not an integer, or k is out of bounds.

    Examples:
    >>> kth_largest(["3", "2", "1", "5", "6", "4"], 2)
    '5'

    >>> kth_largest(["3", "2", "3", "1", "2", "4", "5", "5", "6"], 4)
    '4'

    >>> kth_largest(["3", "2", "3", "1", "2", "4", "5", "5", "6"], 9)
    '1'
