# Collaboration

## Group “ET6-foundations-group-10”

The group is focused on professional communication in developing the _**''“ET6-foundations-group-10”**_ project to implement the _Foundations Track_ syllabus of the [_MIT Emerging Talent_](https://emergingtalent.mit.edu/) program.

### Norms of the group

1. We try to communicate on a professional level on issues related to the project  “ET6-foundations-group-10” development and implementation of the Foundations Track syllabus of the MIT Emerging Talent program. We do not touch on issues of personal characteristics, religious beliefs, political views, or level of competence.
2. We communicate asynchronously using Slack and GitHub tools, so our communication needs to be documented and other group members can view the subject of the communication, the discussion itself, and the results of the communication.
3. All group meetings are scheduled in advance so that other group members can organize their time. All group communication is documented. Personal communication can take place online.
