# Constraints

Some boundaries around our project.

## External

<!--
  constraints coming from the outside that your team has no control over:
  - project deadlines
  - number of unit tests required to pass a code review
  - technologies (sometimes a client will tell you what to use)
  - power or connectivity
  - ...
-->
- *Project Deadlines*: The project deadline is set for January 10th.
- *Project Minimum Requirements*: Each team member must solve two coding
challenges and review two challenges completed by other members.
- *Power or Connectivity Limitations*: Power outages or internet
connectivity issues can disrupt our workflow, causing delays in
communication, collaboration, and access to resources.
- *Amount of Time Available to Work on the Project*: Indicates how
quickly the team responds to project tasks, considering personal
circumstances such as work, school, and other MIT assignments.
- *Security Requirements*: Ensuring all data shared within the team
and implemented in the project meets security standards.
- *Personal Adjustments*: Recently moved to a new country, which involves
hosting numerous guests and meeting extended family for the first time.

## Internal: Involuntary

<!--
  constraints that come from within your team, and you have no control over:
  - each of your individual skill levels
  - amount of time available to work on the project
-->
- *Skills*: I am not proficient in Python programming, which is leading to a
slower pace.
- *Family & Health*: I am taking care of a big family with frequent doctorâ€™s
appointments that interrupt my project schedule.
- *Limited Experience*: Some team members lack experience with certain
technologies, which is slowing down progress.
- *Technical Skills*: Gaps in specific skill sets within the team may require
additional time for learning or external support.
- *Individual Skill Levels*: Some members may need more time to understand and
implement certain aspects of the project, while others may be able to move faster
due to their prior knowledge.
- *Collaboration Experience*: Some team members are more accustomed to teamwork,
communication, and using collaborative tools, while others may be relatively new
to such settings. This can impact the overall efficiency and coordination.
- *Overwhelm*: Adjusting to numerous changes and managing time effectively has
been challenging.
- *Learning Curve*: Balancing the need to acquire and practice new skills and
concepts with limited available time.

## Internal: Voluntary

<!--
  constraints that your team decided on to help scope the project. they may include:
  - coding style & conventions
  - agree on a code review checklist for the project repository
  - the number of hours you want to spend working
  - only using the colors black and white
-->
- *Roles*: Assigning specific responsibilities to each member to ensure clarity
and efficiency.
- *Meetings*: The team should agree to meet frequently for updates and progress
tracking.
- *Deadlines*: Setting internal deadlines to ensure the project stays on track.
- *Commitment*: Strive to meet deadlines and deliver the best possible work
while fostering teamwork and supporting one another.
- *Scope Definition*: Clearly define what is within the project's scope to
avoid unnecessary tasks or "scope creep."
- *Communication Frequency*: Maintain a balance between effective collaboration
and avoiding excessive meetings or updates.
- *Coding Style & Conventions*: Agreed-upon code review checklist for the
project repository.
- *The Number of Hours Dedicated to Working*: Ensuring consistent time allocation
to achieve progress.
- *Only Using Slack for Communication*: Establishing Slack as the primary platform
for all project-related communication.
