# Retrospective for Group Collaboration Project

---

## Section 1: Practices to Stop Doing

### Unhelpful or Counterproductive Practices

- Initially, we hesitated to experiment with GitHub due to concerns about  
  making unfixable changes to the group project repository. However, this
  fear hindered our learning. By implementing feature branches and conducting  
  workshops, we overcame this hesitation and discovered that hands-on  
  experimentation was essential for mastering GitHub effectively.

- Trying to perfect our code from the first commit; we found that working  
  with the team through code revision helped us code better.

- Spending excessive time fine-tuning minor details of the code before  
  completing core functionality.

- Logging the same task as both an issue and a PR instead of linking them  
  caused confusion and redundant work. Linking PRs to issues streamlined the  
  workflow and made task tracking more efficient.

- Weak communication from some members on Slack. Encouraging more consistent  
  and clear updates from all team members is essential.

- Expecting everyone to respond to a problem immediately; we learned to wait  
  and be patient.

### Repetitive or Redundant Tasks to Avoid

- Manually applying code style corrections in multiple sessions rather than  
  using a code formatter.

## Section 2: Practices to Continue Doing

### Valuable or Effective Practices

- Pair programming or review sessions were highly effective as they helped us  
  collaborate and learn from each other’s approaches.

- Regular team check-ins to discuss progress and blockers ensured everyone  
  stayed aligned and helped resolve issues quickly.

**Communication Standards**: Established rules for how and where  
communication occurs (e.g., Slack, GitHub comments) to reduce confusion  
and redundancy.

- **Knowledge Sharing Sessions**: Allocating time for team members to present  
  learnings, solutions, or research findings to the group.

- Reviewing each other’s code and providing advice when stuck: Learning how to  
  work in a team has been really amazing.

- Biweekly updates: These have been effective in keeping the team informed and  
  aligned.

- Dividing tasks between members: This ensures balanced workloads and improves  
  efficiency.

### Activities, Tools, or Methods to Continue

- Git and GitHub were very helpful, especially for screenshots of code and  
  managing the project board.

- Unittest in VS and extensions in VS helped in work and writing markdown  
  files.

- The hands-on GitHub project, where we created pull requests and resolved  
  merge conflicts, was very useful for practical learning.

- Using GitHub’s issue tracker to assign and manage tasks improved  
  accountability and task management within the team.

- Use labels, milestones, and linked issues/PRs  
  on GitHub to better organize tasks and track dependencies.

## Section 3: Practices to Start Doing

### New Practices, Tools, or Techniques to Introduce

- Introduce more coding challenges that mimic real-world scenarios, such as  
  debugging a complex Python script or handling edge cases in Git workflows.

- Use collaborative white-boarding sessions to design project architecture or  
  workflow diagrams.

- Include a mid-project retrospective to assess progress and address blockers  
  early.

- **Pair Coding with Mentorship**: Assign mentors to less experienced team  
  members for pairing on complex tasks, promoting skill-sharing and  
  collaboration.

- **Advanced Task Management**:  

- Create two projects: one advanced and another for beginners. This will cater  
  to varying skill levels and ensure everyone is appropriately challenged.

- Assign the review of specific challenges to designated members to ensure  
  distributed responsibility and a thorough review process.

### Gaps to Address in Future Projects

- We didn’t cover advanced Git features.

- Team members were unfamiliar with tools like GitHub, resulting in delays and  
  inefficiencies due to a lack of initial training on project-specific workflows.

## Section 4: Lessons Learned

### Key Takeaways (Technical and Non-Technical)

#### Technical Lessons

- **Efficient Version Control**: Learning how to use GitHub features like pull  
  requests, issues, and CI/CD workflows to streamline project management and  
  integration.

- **Debugging Techniques**: Gaining skills in identifying and resolving merge  
  conflicts and debugging code effectively.

- **Task Management**: Using labels, milestones, and linked PRs on GitHub to  
  organize tasks and track progress more effectively.

- **Code Quality Improvements**: Understanding the value of using linters,  
  code formatters, and review processes to maintain high coding standards.

#### Non-Technical Lessons

- Learned the importance of teamwork and how to effectively collaborate in a  
  team environment.

- Developed better time management skills by respecting deadlines and the  
  schedules of team members.

- Enhanced communication skills through active discussions and idea-sharing.

- **Collaboration and Communication**: Recognizing the importance of regular  
  check-ins, clear communication standards (e.g., Slack, GitHub comments), and  
  quick feedback loops to ensure alignment.

- **Mentorship and Learning**: Pair coding with mentorship helped team members  
  grow their skills and build confidence.

- **Adaptability**: Adjusting plans when unexpected challenges arise, such as  
  integrating unplanned sessions or adapting to team members’ learning curves.

- **Time Management**: Balancing focus on critical tasks first rather than  
  perfecting minor elements early in the project.

- **Knowledge Sharing**: Gaining insights from other team members through  
  presentations, solutions, or techniques they applied during the project.

## Section 5: Strategy vs. Board

### Plan vs. Reality

#### What Went as Expected

- Timely completion of preliminary modules.
- Smooth division of initial tasks aligned with team members’ skills.
- Effective onboarding process with pre-session materials.
- Consistent team communication with regular check-ins.
- Early identification of roles, leading to a structured workflow.
- Participation in pair programming and knowledge-sharing sessions.
- Helping each other: Some members got stuck on certain tasks, but others  
  assisted by recording videos and organizing meetings to solve problems  
  collaboratively.

#### What Did Not Work as Expected

- Underestimating time for tool familiarity.
- Incomplete role assignment, causing confusion.
- Inefficient communication standards between Slack and GitHub comments.
- Over-focusing on details, delaying critical progress.

## Section 6: Feedback and Suggestions

### Overall Organization of the Group Project

- **Rating**: 4/5. The content was well-structured, but time management could  
  have been better to cover all planned topics.

- Loved the focus on beginner-level participants but noted a gap between  
  participants with varying experience levels.

### Suggestions for Improvement

-Regular Motivation Boosters: Share success stories, milestones achieved, or  
shout-outs for individual contributions to keep participants motivated and appreciated.

-Provide pre-session materials so participants can prepare in advance and use  
  session time efficiently.
