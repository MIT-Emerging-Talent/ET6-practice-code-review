    Checks if a given year is a leap year.

    A leap year:
    - Is divisible by 4, but not divisible by 100, unless it is also divisible by 400.

    Parameters:
        year (int): The year to check. Must be a positive integer.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the year is a leap year, False otherwise.

    Raises:
        TypeError: If the input is not an integer.
        ValueError: If the year is not a positive integer.

    Examples:
        >>> is_leap_year(2020)
        True
        >>> is_leap_year(1900)
        False
