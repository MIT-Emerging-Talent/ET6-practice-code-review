    Estimate the delivery time based on distance and average speed.

        Parameters:
        distance (float): The distance to the delivery location in kilometers.
        average_speed (float): The average speed of the delivery trucks in kilometers per hour.

        Returns:
        float: The estimated delivery time in hours.

        Preconditions:
        - distance must be a non-negative float or int.
        - average_speed must be a positive float or int.

        Raises:
        AssertionError: If any of the preconditions are violated.

        Examples:
        >>> shipment_time_estimation(100, 50)
        2.0
        >>> shipment_time_estimation(1500, 100)
        15.0
        >>> shipment_time_estimation(0, 10)
        0.0


        AssertionError: average_speed must be greater than zero.
        AssertionError: distance must be non-negative.
