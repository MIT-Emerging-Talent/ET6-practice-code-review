# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome: This is `PyRectifier` Group

## We made this repository to practice what we have learnt in the `MIT Foundational Track`

### The most important points that we are as a team individuals practicing here

1. To master using GitHub & Git. (msaeed)
2. To foster my programming skills. (msaeed)
3. To learn how to work collaboratively within groups and organizations by learning and practicing the best practices and approaches. (msaeed)
4. To understand how to plan and execute projects on Github. (Amin)
5. To transform my ideas into programs (Amin)
6. Write unit test files. (Kefah)
7. Practicing Review code. (Kefah)
8. ... (Colleagues: Add what you're thinking about)

### Learning Goals

 Our learning goals are categorized into two main areas: Focus on `Collective Goals`, that is improving together as a team, and `Individual Goals`, that focus on helping individual areas of growth based on the aspirations of each member. This structured approach guarantees both group development and personal development.

        1. Collective Learning Goals:
      

          
   Together, we seek to build a collaborative development environment where we sharpen our technical and communication skills. With practice and continuous learning, weâ€™ll develop a strong foundation in software development and Python programming. The following will be our key points as a collective to learn together.

#### 1. Collaborative Development Skills

- Develop effective collaboration practices through GitHub workflows, including:
  - **Issues**: Creating, tracking, and assigning tasks.
  - **Pull Requests (PRs)**: Submitting, reviewing, and merging pull requests to ensure code quality.
  - **Merging**: Understanding different merge strategies and resolving conflicts.
  - **Projects**: Organizing tasks and milestones using GitHub Projects for visual tracking.
  - **Branching**: Managing branches effectively to keep the repository clean and organized.
  - **GitHub CLI**: Managing repositories, pull requests, and issues from the terminal.

#### 2. Effective Communication

- Enhance communication skills within the team through:
  - **Slack**: Using Slack for group communication.
  - **Regular Meetings**: Actively participate in group meetings and discussions to ensure alignment on goals and progress.
  - **Feedback and Collaboration**: Providing and receiving constructive feedback in both code reviews and team discussions.

#### 3. Unit Testing

- Learn and integrate unit testing in Python using the unittest module.

#### 4. Code Review Process

- Develop an understanding of an effective code review process, giving and receiving constructive feedback to improve code quality.

#### 5. Efficient Development Practices

- Focus on becoming more efficient developers by improving workflows, debugging techniques, and programming skills.

#### 6. Python Programming

- Strengthen Python programming skills by:
  - Writing efficient, and well-documented Python code.

#### 7. Docstring Documentation

- Learn the art of writing.
