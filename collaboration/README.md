TEAMS NORMS

Hold regular informal meetings to Maintain transparency about 
progress and challenges through positive and constructive feedback, 
within the team.

We will build trust by setting aside egos, 
working together, and fostering mutual respect.

Acknowledging mistakes, show commitment to change, 
use a mediator if needed to help resolve conflict, 
share your perspective (in person or anonymously), 
offer solutions.

Discussions are encouraged for collaboration on 
clear instructions, while debates are welcome 
only if they add value to the project. Ensure 
debates remain respectful and focus on ideas, 
not individuals and move to discussion mode if 
tensions rise. Focus on truly understanding 
the other person's viewpoint.

Share a clear agenda in advance, take polls 
to determine convenient meeting times for most 
members, keep most activities asynchronous. 
Conclude each meeting with a summary document 
containing an action plan and assigned responsibilities.

We will primarily utilize Slack for daily discussions, 
reviewing meeting notes, and sharing updates. Zoom 
will be our platform for team meetings, facilitating 
in-depth explanations of workflows, task breakdowns, 
and deliverables. To manage the technical aspects of 
the project, including code development and version 
control, we will leverage GitHub.

Active listening, timely responses, valuing contributions, 
maintaining professional boundaries, having my ideas taken 
seriously, valuing differences, acknowledging contributions, 
honesty, fairness, and equality.

Disrespected: Interruptions, dismissive attitudes, undermining 
and ignoring input, lack of collaboration and transparency,

and communication styles within the team. Avoid discussing or 
asking questions about political situations in anyone’s country 
unless they want to talk about it themselves and finally 
everyone should feel included.

other through challenging topics.
