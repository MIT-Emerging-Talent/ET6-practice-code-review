## Rules and Guidelines

### Building Trust

- Hold regular informal meetings to Maintain  transparency about progress and  
challenges through positive and constructive feedback, within the team.
- build trust by setting aside egos, working together, and fostering mutual respect

### Rebuilding Trust

If trust is damaged:

- Acknowledging mistakes, show commitment to change,use a mediator if needed to help
resolve conflict, share your perspective (in person or anonymously), offer solutions.

### Balancing Discussion and Debate

- Discussions are encouraged for collaboration on clear instructions, while debates
are welcome only if they add value to the project. Ensure debates remain respectful
and focus on ideas, not individuals and move to discussion mode if tensions rise.
Focus on truly understanding the other person's viewpoint.

### Meeting Times and Agendas

- Share a clear agenda in advance, take polls to determine convenient meeting times
for most members, keep most activities asynchronous. Conclude each meeting with a
summary document containing an action plan and assigned responsibilities.

### Communication Platforms

- We will primarily utilize Slack for daily discussions, reviewing meeting notes,
and sharing updates. Zoom will be our platform for team meetings, facilitating in-
depth explanations of workflows, task breakdowns, and deliverables. To manage the
technical aspects of the project, including code development and version control,
 we will leverage GitHub.

### Respectful Interactions

**What Makes Us Feel Respected:**

- Active listening, timely responses, valuing contributions, maintaining professional
boundaries, having my ideas taken seriously, valuing differences, acknowledging
contributions, honesty, fairness, and equality

**What Makes Us Feel Disrespected:**

- Interruptions, dismissive attitudes, undermining and ignoring input, lack of collaboration
and transparency, excessive seriousness, inappropriate jokes, and shouting, Constant
criticism without constructive suggestions for improvement, micromanagement, stereotyping.

### Additional Considerations

- **Cultural Sensitivity:** Be mindful of diverse cultural backgrounds and communication
styles within the team. Avoid discussing or asking questions about political situations
in anyoneâ€™s country unless they want to talk about it themselves and finally everyone
should feel included.

- **Supportive Group Dynamics:** Offering supportive group study sessions to help
each other through challenging topics.
