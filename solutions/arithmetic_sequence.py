         Return a list in which the difference between,
           consecutive terms are constant.


        Parameters:
        sequence_length:int, greater than zero

    Returns -list[int] with the first n number of the arithmetic sequence

    Raises:
        AssertionError : if the argument is not an integer
        AssertionError : if the argument is less or equal to zero

        Examples:
        >>>arithmetic_sequence(0)
        [1]
        >>>arithmetic_sequence(5)
        [0 ,1 ,5 ,9 ,13]
