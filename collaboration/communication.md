## Asking for Help

There's a fine line between confidently learning from your mistakes and stubbornly
 getting nowhere. Here's a structured guide to help you decide when to seek
 assistance, based on how long you've been stuck on the same problem:

### Step 1: Try by Yourself

- Keep trying as long as you're making progress.
- Experiment with different approaches and learn from your mistakes.
- Use available resources like documentation, tutorials, and examples.
- This stage is where you’ll learn the most by doing.

### Step 2: Hit a Wall?

- Continue trying for as much time as you're willing to invest.
- When you feel like you're running in circles or not learning anything new, it
might be time to move on.

### Step 3: Ask the Group

- Collaborate with the group to find a solution on Slack or Whatsapp.
- Explain the problem clearly to your peers; often, teaching it helps you discover
  new insights.
- If the group cannot find an answer within a day, it’s time to escalate.

### Step 4: Go on Slack

- Reach out to coaches and peers on Slack.
- Provide a concise and clear explanation of the problem.
- Share any relevant code snippets, error messages, or steps you’ve already tried.

>_Remember, asking for help is part of the learning process. It’s not about giving
up; it’s about finding the balance between perseverance and seeking guidance._
