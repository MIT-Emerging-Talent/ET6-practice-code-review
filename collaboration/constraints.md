# Constraints

Some boundaries around our project.

## 1. External Constraints

- **Program Requirements**
  The CDS program's expectations for group collaboration and
  deliverables, such
  as using GitHub for documentation.
- **Time Zones**
  Group members are located in different parts of the world, making it
  challenging to find universally convenient meeting times.
- **Communication Tools**
  Limitations of WhatsApp and Slack for certain tasks like file sharing or code reviews.

## 2. Internal Constraints: Involuntary

- **Skill Gaps**
  Not all group members may have the same proficiency in tools like GitHub or
  collaboration platforms.
- **Time Commitment**
  Some members might have more demanding schedules or competing priorities.
- **Cultural Differences**
  Diverse perspectives may lead to misunderstandings or disagreements.

## 3. Internal Constraints: Voluntary

- **Respecting Time**
  A norm to wait 5 minutes for late members during meetings before starting.
- **Conflict Resolution**
   A voluntary decision to resolve conflicts one-on-on first and escalate
   only if needed.
- **Engagement**
  Choosing to actively check and contribute to all communication channels daily.
