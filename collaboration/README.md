## Group Norms

## Discussions

- We as a group will try first of all to maintain a healthy and safe work environment.
- We as a group will be open to an unexpected direction and strive to learn.

---

## Debate

- We as a group will try to define the scope and objective of our debate clearly.
- We as a group will try to debate positions/terms/ideas/concepts/themes.
- We as a group will try our best to take turns during the debates to debate both
  sides of the debate.
- Our intention during the debate should always be **POSITIVE**!
- Being open to accepting changes, new concepts, ideas, and diverse opinions.
- When nobody is willing to compromise, then we will turn to a group **VOTING**.
- When two people are debating, we can consider having a negotiator between them.

## Timing

- We as a group will have a good intention when it comes to respecting each other’s
  time. We will try to be on time; however, if we can’t make it on time, let's
  inform the group beforehand. In exceptional cases, when there is an urgency
  and we are in a position not even to inform, our intention is what matters.
- We cannot be present at some meetings/activities, but what matters the most is
  our presence in the group in general. We will try our best to be active when
  having time and contribute to the best of our abilities.
- We will all make sure to recognize the role of external factors, which are often
  out of our control. In such a situation, what matters the most is to let our
  group members know that we are here to support them and that they can count on
  us.
- Deadlines are important, but communication matters the most. There is always
  space for communication.
- As a group, we will arrange a meeting 48 hours ahead and set the agenda of the
  meeting, and when setting a time, the majority availability should be taken into
  consideration—for example, (a WhatsApp poll).
- Before working on a task, we should set a **SPECIFIC TIME** for that **TASK**!

---

## Trust

- Trust is a default, and throughout our journey, we will build this trust.
- We as a group will build a trustful relationship. One way to build trust would
  be to participate in a small experiment, which will allow us to make personal
  connections. On New Year's Eve or whenever we have time, we will write a very
  small paragraph about ourselves and share it in the WhatsApp group with each
  other (maybe backing it up with a picture if we want). Submit everything on time.
- In our group, there is no space for **DISRESPECT**, **INDIFFERENCE**, and **BETRAYAL**!
- We as a group should feel confident/free to ask questions, and we should try
  to answer each other’s questions.
- Accept our responsibilities, work hard to get them done, and if challenges are
  faced, we should communicate them to the group.

## Refining

- We will maintain a supportive and safe environment where all members feel valued
  and heard.
- We will stay open to learning and adapting by embracing new ideas, perspectives,
  and changes.
- We will approach debates with positivity and respect by focusing on ideas, not
  individuals, and aiming for productive outcomes.
- We will communicate openly and clearly to address challenges, share updates,
  and foster understanding within the group.
- We will respect each other’s time and commitments by being mindful of
  punctuality, deadlines, and external circumstances.
- We will build and maintain trust by being reliable, honest, and supportive in
  all interactions.
- We will take responsibility for our contributions and support each other in
  overcoming challenges.
- We will make decisions collaboratively by valuing diverse opinions and using
  group consensus or voting when needed.
- We will foster connections within the group to strengthen our relationships
  and create a positive team dynamic.
- We will adapt our norms as needed to reflect the group’s evolving needs and priorities.
