## Code Review Template

This template ensures best practices are followed during code reviews, focusing on functionality, documentation, and testing. It provides a structured approach to evaluate code quality.

### Challenge Overview

Briefly describe the challenge being addressed by the solution.

---

### Checklist for Review

---

#### Files

- [ ] The file name accurately describes the function’s behavior and purpose.
- [ ] The function file includes a module docstring that provides a high-level overview.
- [ ] The test file matches the function file name, e.g., `/tests/test_file_name.py`.
- [ ] The test file contains a module docstring.

---

#### Unit Tests

- [ ] The test class follows PascalCase naming conventions.
- [ ] The test class contains a descriptive docstring explaining its purpose.
- Each unit test includes:
  - [ ] A clear and descriptive name.
  - [ ] A comprehensive docstring outlining its steps.
  - [ ] Only one assertion per test for clarity.
  - [ ] No logic within the unit test—only assertions.
- [ ] All tests pass successfully.
- [ ] Defensive assertions are included for handling edge and boundary cases.

---

#### Function Docstring

- [ ] The function’s behavior is fully described.
- Arguments are documented with:
  - [ ] Type.
  - [ ] Purpose.
  - [ ] Any necessary assumptions (e.g., expected range or constraints).
- The return value is clearly documented:
  - [ ] Type.
  - [ ] Additional assumptions (if any) are provided.
- Defensive assertions are used to validate assumptions about arguments:
  - [ ] Each assertion checks a single assumption.
  - [ ] `Raises:` is used for documenting defensive assertions.

- [ ] At least 3 passing doctests are included to validate the function’s behavior.

---

#### The Function

- [ ] The function’s name accurately reflects its purpose and matches the file name.
- [ ] Correct type annotations are included in the function.
- [ ] The function is not invoked within its own file.

---

## Strategy

### Best Practices

- [ ] Variable names are descriptive and enhance code readability.
- [ ] Comments are concise and explain the strategy rather than implementation details.
- [ ] Code is spaced logically to highlight different stages of the strategy.

### Avoid Excessive Comments

- [ ] Avoid comments that describe the implementation steps unnecessarily.
- [ ] Ensure that the function has a balanced number of comments relative to its lines of code.

---

## Implementation

- [ ] The code adheres to formatting standards.
- [ ] All linting checks (e.g., Ruff, Pylint) are passed.
- [ ] Variables are named using snake_case and are meaningful.
- [ ] The code is simple, yet effective, adhering to the chosen strategy.
- [ ] Defensive assertions are included with minimal logic.
- [ ] There are no commented-out lines or unnecessary `print` statements.
