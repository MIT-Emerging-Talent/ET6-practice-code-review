Building Steps Calculator

This module provides functionality to calculate
 the number of steps required to reach a specific floor
   in a building. It includes a core function
     for the calculation and a wrapper function for handling user input.

    Core function to calculate the number of steps required to reach a given floor in a building,
    assuming it takes 10 steps to move between consecutive floors.

    Parameters:
      target_floor: int, the floor number to reach (positive, negative, or zero).

    Returns:
      int: the total number of steps required.

    Raises:
      AssertionError: If the target_floor is not an integer.

    Examples:
    >>> steps_to_floor_core(0)
    0
    >>> steps_to_floor_core(1)
    10
    >>> steps_to_floor_core(5)
