# Learning Goals  

Our team comprises ten members with diverse backgrounds, including those new to
coding and others with significant experience. This variety presents an excellent
opportunity for mutual learning and growth. Below are the learning goals we have
collectively identified for these exercises:  

## Objectives for Team Members New to Coding  

- **Build foundational knowledge**: Understand the basics of data structures (DSs)
  and algorithms.  
- **Learn programming best practices**: Focus on writing clean, readable, and well-
  documented code.  
- **Practice problem-solving**: Develop confidence in tackling coding problems
step by step.  
- **Gain exposure to code review**: Learn how to give and receive constructive feedback
  to improve solutions.  

## Objectives for Experienced Team Members  

- **Strengthen advanced skills**: Dive deeper into complex DSs and algorithms to
enhance problem-solving capabilities.  
- **Experiment with new approaches**: Explore and apply new programming language
features to refine solutions.  
- **Focus on optimization**: Work on producing efficient and scalable code.  
- **Mentor and collaborate**: Guide less experienced team members to create an
inclusive and supportive learning environment.  

## Shared Team Objectives  

- **Learn through collaboration**: Share knowledge and perspectives to maximize
learning outcomes for everyone.  
- **Improve development speed**: Practice writing solutions faster while maintaining
quality.  
- **Foster a culture of feedback**: Embrace multiple cycles of review to improve
individual and team skills.  
- **Document solutions effectively**: Ensure every solution is well-commented and
easy to understand for future reference.  

These goals reflect our commitment to leveraging our diverse skills and experiences
to grow together as a team. Weâ€™ll revisit and refine these objectives as needed
to ensure alignment with our progress and expectations.
