    """
    Evaluates supplier performance based on delivery reliability and defect rates.

    The function calculates a performance score (0-100) by combining the percentage
    of on-time deliveries and the percentage of defect-free items. The two metrics
    are equally weighted in the score.

    Parameters:
        on_time_deliveries (int): Number of on-time deliveries.
        total_deliveries (int): Total number of deliveries (must be greater than 0).
        defective_items (int): Number of defective items.
        total_items (int): Total items delivered (must be greater than 0).

    Returns:
        float: Supplier performance score (0-100).

    Raises:
        ValueError: If any input is negative or total_deliveries/total_items is zero.

    Examples:
        >>> calculate_supplier_performance_score(45, 50, 10, 100)
        90.0
        >>> calculate_supplier_performance_score(10, 10, 0, 20)
        100.0
        >>> calculate_supplier_performance_score(0, 10, 5, 20)
