# Constraints

---

This file reflects some boundaries and challenges that may face our group and project

## External

These are constraints coming from the outside and we (as a team)
have no control over, for example:

- **Project deadlines**
  - The project must be completed within 3 weeks, with a clear
  deadline for each deliverable.
- **Programming Language: Python**
  - Python will be used to build the project. No other languages
   or frameworks will be used.
- **Version Control with GitHub:**
  - The code related to the project has to be pushed to the GitHub
   repository And pull requests should be reviewed before merging.
- **Testing Framework: Unittest**
  - For testing purposes, the project will use unittest for Python.
   And no other testing libraries or frameworks will be introduced.
- **Documentation Standards:**
  - During the project, all code should have clear and concise
   documentation (using docstrings).
- **Team Size:**
  - A team of 10 members will work on this project.
  All members will be expected to collaborate.

## Internal: Involuntary

These are constraints that come from within our team and we have no
control over but we can work on mitigating them:

- **Skills level:**
  - Team members have different levels of experience and
  familiarity with programming, Git&GitHub.

- **amount of time available to work on the project**
  - Due to work or life responsibilities, each team member
 has a different amount of time that he can use to work on this project.
- **Communication issues**

## Internal: Voluntary

These are the types of constraints that we’ve decided on to help scope the project.
They include:

- coding style & conventions
- Follow the code review checklist for the project repository
- The number of hours you want to spend working
- Agreed to use Slack as the main communication channel
- Agreed to use Google Meet for meetings
- We may share the insights or challenges that we faced during problem-solving
  to help others learn and reduce the potential time that may be wasted on debugging
- Meeting Frequency and Duration:
  - Group meetings should be held at least once a week for up to 1 hour. That said,
  team availability will factor into scheduling and it’s expected that all team
  members will participate.
- Agreed on completing any outstanding tasks by **January** the **7th**.
