    """Calculate the count of integers satisfying specific divisibility conditions.

    This function finds integers between the maximum of `a` and the minimum of `b` (inclusive)
    that are divisible by all elements in `a` and are factors of all elements in `b`.

    Args:
        a (List[int]): A list of integers to act as divisors.
        b (List[int]): A list of integers to act as multiples.

    Returns:
        int: The count of integers meeting the criteria.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If either list is empty.
        TypeError: If inputs are not lists of integers.

    Examples:
        >>> between_two_sets([2, 4], [16, 32, 96])
        3
        >>> between_two_sets([1], [100])

        >>> between_two_sets([3], [12])
        3
