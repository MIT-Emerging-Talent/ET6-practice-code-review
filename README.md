# Git it Done  

## Overview  

Welcome to the **Git it Done** repository!  

This is a collaborative learning project where our team works together to solve
problems and learn new skills. Each teammate will:  

- Solve 2 problems.  
- Help resolve 2 problems contributed by others.  

Our team is made up of people with different levels of experienceâ€”some of us are
complete beginners, while others have a little experience. But one thing we all
share is a strong eagerness to learn. By the end of this project, we will no longer
 be complete beginners.  

We are learning collaboratively, growing through our mistakes, and working as a
team to improve.  .
