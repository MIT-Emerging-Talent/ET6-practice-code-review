"""
This module contains the implementation of the `merge_dictionaries` function.

The `merge_dictionaries` function allows merging two dictionaries into one,
with support for resolving key conflicts through a custom resolution function.

def merge_dictionaries(dict1, dict2, conflict_resolution=None):
    """
    Merge two dictionaries into one.

    If keys conflict, a conflict resolution function can be provided
    to decide which value to keep. If no function is provided, the value
    from `dict2` will overwrite the value from `dict1`.

    Parameters:
        dict1 (dict): The first dictionary.
        dict2 (dict): The second dictionary.
        conflict_resolution (function, optional): A function that takes
            two arguments (value1, value2) and returns the resolved value.

    Returns:
        dict: A merged dictionary.

    Raises:
        AssertionError: If `dict1` or `dict2` is not a dictionary.
        AssertionError: If `conflict_resolution` is not callable when provided.

    Examples:
        >>> merge_dictionaries({'a': 1}, {'a': 2, 'b': 3})
        {'a': 2, 'b': 3}
        >>> merge_dictionaries({'a': 1}, {'a': 2, 'b': 3}, max)
        {'a': 2, 'b': 3}
        >>> merge_dictionaries({'x': 1}, {'y': 2})
        {'x': 1, 'y': 2}
