# Constraints README 📝

## Introduction 🌟

Welcome to the Constraints README! This document is here to help us understand
the challenges and limitations each team member faces while working on this project.
Since we're all learning and working remotely, there can be obstacles like different
time zones 🌍, schedules ⏰, weak internet 🌐, power outages ⚡, or simply being
new to GitHub 💻.

By outlining these constraints, we aim to make collaboration easier and ensure
everyone feels supported as we learn and grow together. Don’t worry, this is a
beginner-friendly space, and we’re all here to help each other improve!

## Purpose 🎯

The goal of this document is to identify and acknowledge the constraints we each
face while working on this project. By being transparent about our challenges,
we can plan better, support each other, and ensure smooth progress as a team.

## Constraints ⚖️

### External Constraints 🌐

These are factors that come from the outside and are beyond the team's control:

<!-- We decided to break the MD013/line-length rule for aesthetic reasons-->

| **Constraint**                    | **Description**                                                                  |
|------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Project Deadlines** ⏳           | Deadlines set externally that affect how quickly we need to deliver.            |
| **Number of Unit Tests** 🧪       | The number of unit tests required to pass a code review.                         |
| **Schedules**                      | Academic, work, or personal commitments that limit availability.                |
| **Power or Connectivity Issues** ⚡| Unpredictable external problems like power outages or poor internet that could disrupt work. |

### Internal: Involuntary Constraints 🚶‍♀️

These are factors that come from within the team, and we have no control over them:

| **Constraint**            | **Description**                                                                |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Individual Skill Levels** 🧑‍💻 | Varying levels of expertise among team members.                           |
| **Task Preferences** ✅     | Specific tasks you enjoy or want to focus on to improve your skills.         |
| **Time Availability** ⏰   | The amount of time available to work on the project may vary from person to person. |
| **Communication Delays** 💬 | Just a heads-up, replies might take a little longer since we're all working at different times or with flexible schedules. |

### Internal: Voluntary Constraints 🙋‍♂️

| **Constraint**                       | **Description**                                                                 |
|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Coding Style & Conventions** 🎨     | Deciding on a standard coding style (e.g., indentations, naming conventions).  |
| **Code Review Checklist** ✅         | Creating a checklist for code reviews to ensure consistency and all code must be reviewed before merging into the main branch with constructive feedback. |
| **Hours to Spend Working** 🕒        | Deciding on a specific amount of time the team wants to spend working per week. |
| **GitHub & Version Control Constraints** 🔄 | All work must be committed to GitHub regularly. Each task or feature should be worked on in its own separate branch. |
| **Branch Names** 🌿                 | Must be descriptive, clear and related to the problem.                      |
| **Time-Sensitive Tasks** ⏱️         | Should be addressed promptly (e.g., bug fixes or urgent feature additions).     |
| **Resource Constraints** 📚          | All team members need to have access to the necessary tools and resources (VS Code, GitHub, Necessary extensions). |
| **Communication Tools** 🛠️           | Slack for daily updates, Google Meet for weekly meetings.                      |

## Tips for Managing Challenges 💡

Here are some simple tips to help us overcome common constraints:

- **Time Zones:** 🕑 Use a shared tool like Google Calendar to plan meetings at
times that work for everyone.
- **Weak Internet:** 🌐 Keep changes small and commit frequently to avoid large uploads.
- **GitHub Beginners:** 🚀 Start with the GitHub Desktop app for an easier
introduction to Git.

## Individual Constraints 🧑‍🤝‍🧑

If you're facing any challenges or have specific constraints,
feel free to post them directly
as issues on GitHub!
This will help everyone stay on the same page and
allow us to work together in solving them.

### **Here’s how you can create an issue:** 🚨

1. Head over to the GitHub Issues section of our project.
1. Click on "New Issue."
1. Use the template to share your constraint.
1. Tag it with helpful labels like
1. Add any details that will help us understand how we can best support you.
