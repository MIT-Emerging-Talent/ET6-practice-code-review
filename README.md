# The Buggy Coders ðŸ’»

  Have you ever wondered how the `undo` feature
  in Gmail was created? Well, wonder no more! All credit goes to bugs!
  
  Welcome to **The Buggy Coders** official repository! We're the
  kind of coders who believe that every bug is just an undocumented feature
  waiting to be discovered. We're a team of aspiring tech wizards who are
  currently battling a swarm of elusive bugs in our code. Expect the unexpected
  as we navigate the exciting (and occasionally chaotic) world of programming.
  **We're here to learn, laugh, and hopefully produce something that doesn't
  crash the entire internet. Wish us luck!**
