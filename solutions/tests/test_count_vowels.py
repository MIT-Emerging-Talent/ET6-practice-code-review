"""
Unit tests for the count_vowels module.

This module contains a suite of tests for the count_vowels function, which counts
the number of vowels in a given string. The function handles both uppercase
and lowercase vowels and ensures correct results for edge cases, such as
empty strings, strings with no vowels, and strings with special characters
or whitespace.

Examples:
    count_vowels("hello") -> 2
    count_vowels("HELLO") -> 2
    count_vowels(" A e i o u ") -> 5
