## Asking for Help

There's a fine line between confidently learning from your mistakes, and
stubbornly getting no where. Here is a general guide for when to ask for help
based on how long you've been stuck on the same problem:

1. *0 -> 30 min*: Try on your own
1. *30 -> 60 min*: Ask your group for help
1. *60+ min*: Tag your coaches in Slack or GitHub
