    Returns the maximum profit from as many stock transactions as possible.

    Parameters:
        prices (list): A list of non-negative integers or floats representing the stock prices
                        on different days. Each price is greater than or equal to zero."

    Raises:
        AssertionError: If `prices` is not a list.
        AssertionError: If any element in `prices` is not a numeric type (either int or float).
        AssertionError: If any price in `prices` is less than zero.

    Examples:
        >>> calculate_max_profit([7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4])
        7
        >>> calculate_max_profit([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
