# _Our Norms_ 🌠

**_1._** We will respect each other’s time in synchronous and asynchronous communication.⌚

**_2._** We will work together, share ideas, and help each other whenever needed
and possible to achieve the best results.🤝

**_3._** We will give constructive criticism about the work, and not about the person
who did the job, fostering an amicable work environment to ensure that everyone
has a chance to express their opinions.💭

**_4._** We will wait for each other and won’t pressure anyone to work or study
at a specific time. Some of us might have different priorities and other responsibilities.🤗

**_5._** We will speak up when we do not understand the material and use our teammates
as resources.🙋🏻
