# Constraints

Some boundaries around our project.

## External

<!--
  constraints coming from the outside that your team has no control over:
  - project deadlines
  - number of unit tests required to pass a code review
  - technologies (sometimes a client will tell you what to use)
  - power or connectivity
  - ...
-->

- **Timing Constraints:** The team was distributed across multiple time zones.
Scheduling meetings and achieving real-time collaboration were difficult. Tasks
that required input from multiple members often took longer due to delayed communication.

## Internal: Involuntary

<!--
  constraints that come from within your team, and you have no control over:
  - each of your individual skill levels
  - amount of time available to work on the project
-->

- **Familiarity with GitHub:** Some team members were unfamiliar with GitHub
workflows, such as branching,
merging, and resolving conflicts. This led to delays in integrating code changes
and occasional errors when managing pull requests or resolving merge conflicts.
- **Knowledge Gap in Programming:** The team had varying levels of programming
expertise. Some members were proficient in the required technologies, while
others were still learning. This knowledge disparity created dependencies where
experienced members had to spend additional time mentoring or reviewing code,
slowing down overall progress.

## Internal: Voluntary

<!--
  constraints that your team decided on to help scope the project. they may include:
  - coding style & conventions
  - agree on a code review checklist for the project repository
  - the number of hours you want to spend working
  - only using the colors black and white
-->

- **Coding Style & Conventions:**
The team agreed to follow specific coding styles and conventions to maintain
consistency across the project.
- **Skill Development:** Encouraging paired programming sessions and providing
access to learning resources were voluntarily adopted to bridge the skill gap effectively.
