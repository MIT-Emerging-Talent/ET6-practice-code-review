# Collaboration

## Group Norms

Group norms are the shared values, rules, and expectations that guide our
behavior, communication, and interactions within the team. By establishing clear
norms, we aim to create an inclusive, productive, and collaborative environment
where every member feels valued and empowered. Our team thrives on openness,
respect, and the shared belief that collaboration makes us stronger.

## Core Principles

### Respect and Inclusivity
- Acknowledge and appreciate the diverse backgrounds, perspectives, and
contributions of all team members.
- Foster a safe space for open expression, where constructive feedback is
encouraged, and differing opinions are welcomed.

### Clear Communication
- Use clear, concise, and respectful language in all communications.
- Prioritize active listening during discussions and avoid interrupting others.
- Clarify misunderstandings promptly and assume good intentions when
interpreting messages.

### Collaboration and Teamwork
- Share responsibilities and ensure equitable participation in tasks.
- Support each other by sharing knowledge, offering help, and celebrating
achievements.
- Commit to resolving conflicts constructively and collaboratively.

### Accountability and Commitment
- Take responsibility for completing assigned tasks on time and to the best of
your ability.
- Communicate proactively about challenges or delays to ensure transparency.
- Honor commitments made to the group and follow through on agreements.

### Adaptability and Growth
- Be open to feedback and willing to make improvements based on team discussions
- Embrace flexibility in adapting to new tools, workflows, or ideas introduced
by the group.
- Commit to ongoing learning and professional development as a team.

## Norms in Practice

### Communication Norms
- Utilize team communication platforms (e.g., Slack, GitHub, Whatsapp, or email)
for updates, questions, and discussions.
- Maintain professionalism in all written and verbal interactions.
- Schedule regular check-ins or stand-ups to monitor progress and address
concerns.

### Collaboration Norms
- Use shared tools like GitHub for version control, task assignments, and
documentation.
- Follow branch naming conventions and adhere to agreed processes for code
reviews.
- Complete the collaboration/retrospective.md document at the end of the project
to reflect on successes and areas for improvement.

### Conflict Resolution
- Approach conflicts with a mindset of dialogue rather than debate.
- Use "I" statements to express concerns constructively (e.g., "I feel X when Y
happens").
- Seek input from the group or a mediator if conflicts cannot be resolved
independently.

### Meeting Norms
- Start and end meetings on time, with a clear agenda and objectives.
- Ensure everyone has an opportunity to speak and contribute.
- Summarize key takeaways and action items at the end of each meeting.

### Inclusion Norms
- Be mindful of language barriers or time zone differences when scheduling
meetings or assigning tasks.
- Rotate leadership roles for tasks or meetings to ensure equitable
participation.
- Celebrate cultural diversity by sharing customs, holidays, or traditions
during appropriate occasions.

### Group Norms Summary
- Feedback is given constructively, aiming to improve ideas rather than
criticize individuals.
- We communicate transparently and ensure all intentions are clear, fostering
trust among the team.
- If someone doesn’t have an answer, they openly admit it, and we work together
to find solutions.
- Concerns or ideas are raised immediately, ensuring smooth progress without
unnecessary delays.
- Every contribution is valuable, and all ideas are treated with respect and
consideration.
- Personal attacks are off-limits; we engage respectfully, focusing on ideas
rather than people.

## Ongoing Evolution
Group norms are not static. We commit to revisiting and updating these norms
based on feedback, changing circumstances, and lessons learned from our
collaborative experiences. By aligning with these norms, we aim to foster a
supportive team culture that enables high performance and mutual growth.
