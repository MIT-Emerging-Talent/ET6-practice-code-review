# Constraints

This document outlines the key boundaries and constraints for our project.
These guidelines will help ensure alignment and smooth collaboration throughout
the project.

## External

<!--
  constraints coming from the outside that your team has no control over:
  - project deadlines
  - number of unit tests required to pass a code review
  - technologies (sometimes a client will tell you what to use)
  - power or connectivity
  - ...
-->
These constraints are beyond our team's control and have
been imposed by external factors:

- **Official Deadline:** The project must be completed by **10.01.2025**
(extended until 12.01.2025).
- **Number of Unit test:** We were not under any compulsion to have
a specific number of unit tests, however we were advised to test our
functions in different ways in order to make it robust, reliable, and
behaves correctly under any conditions such as edge cases that ensures
our software under unusual but valid inputs still works.
- **Tools and Platforms:** We will use **GitHub** for version
control and **Python** for development.
- **Code Review Requirements:** Each pull request must be reviewed
by at least one other team member before merging.
- **Accessibility and Connectivity:** Team members must ensure they have reliable
internet access to collaborate effectively.

## Internal: Involuntary

<!--
  constraints that come from within your team, and you have no control over:
  - each of your individual skill levels
  - amount of time available to work on the project
-->
These constraints come from within our team and are beyond our control:

- **Time Zone Differences:** Team members are in different time zones,
requiring asynchronous work and collaboration.
- **Varied Availability:** Each team member has different primary
responsibilities, which may limit available time for the project.
- **Varying Skill Levels:** Team members have different levels of experience
with **Python** and **GitHub**, which may affect task completion speed and code quality.
- **Learning Curves:** As this project is part of a learning track, team members
are still in the process of mastering some of the technologies and practices, which
may affect productivity.
- **Health and Well-being:** Team members' health and well-being take priority,
   and any health-related issues may impact project timelines.
- **Unforeseen Circumstances:** Unexpected events like personal
   emergencies may affect team members' availability.
- **Work-Life Balance:** Team members must balance project work
  with other personal and professional commitments.

## Internal: Voluntary

<!--
  constraints that your team decided on to help scope the project. they may include:
  - coding style & conventions
  - agree on a code review checklist for the project repository
  - the number of hours you want to spend working
  - only using the colors black and white
-->

These constraints are decisions made by the team to help scope and guide the project:

- **Submission Requirements:** All personal branches with functions must be
added to the project by **06.01.2025** (internal deadline),
with corresponding pull requests for each team member.
- **Task Division:** Team members will work on separate branches to minimize
merge conflicts and maintain clear ownership of tasks.
- **Review Process:** Each pull request must be thoroughly reviewed by at
least one other team member to ensure code quality and prevent errors.
- **Communication Channels:** We will use **Slack/WhatsApp** for general communication
and **GitHub** for technical discussions. **Zoom** may be used for synchronous
meetings if necessary.
- **Learning Goals:** Each team member will contribute tasks that align with
their personal learning objectives for the project.
- **Coding Standards:** We will follow a common coding style guide to ensure consistency
throughout the project. All code must adhere to **PEP8** standards and be well-documented.
- **Meeting Cadence:** Regular team meetings will be held once
   a week to ensure alignment and progress tracking.
- **Documentation Standards:** All code and project documentation must be
   maintained in a consistent and organized manner.
- **Code Quality Metrics:** The team will adhere to code quality metrics such as
   maintaining a certain percentage of test coverage and ensuring minimal code duplication.
- **Knowledge Sharing:** Team members will share their learnings
   and insights through regular knowledge-sharing sessions.

This document serves as a framework to ensure all team members understand
the constraints and expectations for the project. All changes and feedback will
be reviewed before merging into the main branch.
