## Problem-Solving Protocol

As a general rule of the group, we will follow these steps when encountering a problem:

1. **0 → 30 minutes**: Work on the problem independently.  
2. **30 → 60 minutes**: Discuss the problem with the group to gather support and ideas.  
3. **60+ minutes**: Reach out to coaches via Slack or GitHub for guidance.

This approach ensures efficient collaboration and maximizes learning opportunities for all group members.
