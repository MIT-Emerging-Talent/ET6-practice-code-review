# Constraints

Some boundaries around our project.

## 1. External Constraints

- **Program Requirements** :
  The CDS program's expectations for group collaboration and
  deliverables, such
  as using GitHub for documentation.
- **Time Zones** :
  Group members are located in different parts of the world, making it
  challenging to find universally convenient meeting times.
- **Communication Tools** :
  Limitations of WhatsApp and Slack

    For example, team members are unable to send large video files explaining
    essential topics, such as how to use GitHub for collaboration, due to file
    size
    restrictions and the lack of video management features, which hinders effective
    knowledge sharing.  

## 2. Internal Constraints: Involuntary

- **Skill Gaps** :
  Not all group members may have the same proficiency in tools like GitHub or
  collaboration platforms.
- **Time Commitment** :
  Some members might have more demanding schedules or competing priorities.
- **Cultural Differences** :
  Diverse perspectives may lead to misunderstandings or disagreements.

## 3. Internal Constraints: Voluntary

- **Respecting Time** :
  A norm to wait 5 minutes for late members during meetings before starting.
- **Conflict Resolution** :
   A voluntary decision to resolve conflicts one-on-one first and escalate
   only if needed.
- **Engagement** :
  Choosing to actively check and contribute to all communication channels daily.
