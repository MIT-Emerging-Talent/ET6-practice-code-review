# ⚙️ **Project Boundaries & Constraints**

## 🚧 **Clear Boundaries for Efficiency**

To ensure efficiency and balanced contributions, the project
 should have **clear boundaries**.

- Roles and responsibilities should be **well-defined** to prevent
 overlapping efforts.
- Expectations should be set for **balanced contributions**, considering
 each member’s **constraints**.
- A **culture of constructive feedback** and solution-focused discussions should
  be established.
- A **clear process** for resolving conflicts is essential.

These boundaries aim to create a **productive** and
 **supportive environment** for the team.

## 🌍 **External Constraints**

The team faces several **external constraints** impacting collaboration:
