# Learning Goals

## Collective

## Individual

**Justina** - *My goal is to learn how to collaborate efficiently with a team on
Github.*
I intend to share simple coding challenges from our previous programming classes.
This will ensure all team members are familiar with the challenges and actively
participate in solving them, hence meeting my learning objective
