# Constraints  

## External  

- **Project Deadline and Stakes**:  
  
  Although we aspire to take a gradual approach to mastering the tools and
  algorithms required for the project, the tight deadline places significant
  pressure on our team. Missing this deadline could result in severe
  consequences, including program eviction.  

- **Project Requirements**:  
  
  The project demands proficiency in Git/GitHub, code documentation, testing,
  reviewing, and effective collaboration. These requirements exceed the current
  skill levels of some team members, posing challenges to our progress.  

- **Accessibility to Computers**:  
  
  Some team members share computers with others in their households. For
  instance, one member shares a computer with their sister, who lives in
  another city. Access is often limited to weekends or family visits, leading
  to delays and stress.  

- **Software Compatibility**:  

  One team member faced challenges downloading necessary tools like VS Code and
  Git due to their laptop's ARM processor. Extensive research was required to
  find compatible versions of the software.  

## Internal: Involuntary  

- **Skill Gap**:  
  
  The team comprises individuals with varying levels of familiarity with the
  tools and techniques required for the project. This expertise gap can hinder
  effective communication, collaboration, and overall efficiency.  

- **Personal Availability**:  
  
  Despite strong motivation, personal challenges occasionally arise, forcing
  some members to be unavailable. These absences can delay progress and place
  additional responsibilities on others.  

- **Scheduling Conflicts**:  

  Due to differing schedules and backgrounds, finding suitable times for
  everyone to meet is challenging. However, the team has shown dedication by
  following up at least twice a week to engage and work together.  

## Internal: Voluntary  

- **Group Norms**:  

  - Chose WhatsApp as the primary communication app after Slack.  
  - Created demos and documented meetings to help members catch up.  
  - Set reminders, created polls, and used the GitHub project board to share
  agendas and address issues/tasks.  

- **Code Review Process**:  

  The team follows the instructor's suggestions and adheres to a standard code
  review checklist. This ensures a consistent approach to coding and builds
  good habits for the future.  

- **Coding Style**:

  The team agrees on a simple and testable coding style that all members can
  review and understand.
