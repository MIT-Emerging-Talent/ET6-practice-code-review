## Key Discussion Points

### **1. Overview of Group Project**

- Discussed the required outcomes of the group project in terms of
documents and Deliverable.

### **2. Establishing Rules**

- Agreed on rules to avoid direct merges into the `main` branch without first
creating pull requests.
- Agreed that pull requests require approval from at least two reviewers.

### **3. Branching Strategy**

- Yuriy shared a helpful document detailing the steps and commands needed.
Please find it in our slack channel.
- Decided to create individual branches for each file worked on locally
and "push" them to GitHub rather than working directly in the `main` branch.
- Ensured branch naming aligns with Yuriy's file for consistency and accessibility:
  - Format: `file-name-<your name>`
  - Example: `group-norms-khadija`

### **4. Practical Steps Practiced**

- Gained familiarity with creating and pushing branches.
- Practiced the full cycle of creating pull requests,
assigning "Reviewers," and completing the review process.
- Each participant shared their screen to demonstrate these steps.

### **5. Resolving Issues**

- Resolved a conflict and learned the technical steps to address it effectively.

### **6. Projects Tab Overview**

- Had an introductory overview of the "Projects" tab and its functionalities.

### **7. README.md Files**

- Clarified the misunderstanding between:
  - `README.md` in the root directory which is mainly for Group's overview and description.
  - `README.md` in the "collaboration" directory
which we'll post our final Group's norms.

### **8. Collaboration Strategy**

- Agreed to split into groups to work on files under the "collaboration" folder,
with reviews required from all other team members.
- Decided that all team members will work on the "group norms" file simultaneously.
- Agreed to start adding problems before completing the files
to allow for early discussion.
- Set a deadline for solving problems to ensure sufficient time for review and
to address any conflicts in branches or the repository.

2. Continue practicing the GitHub workflow to solidify understanding.
3. Explore the "Projects" tab further to utilize its full potential.
4. Begin collaborative work on the "group norms" file and other assigned tasks.
