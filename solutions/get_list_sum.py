    Calculates the sum of a list of numbers provided by the user.

    Parameters:
        sequence_length: The number of elements to be entered by the user.
            Must be a non-negative integer.

    Returns -> int:
        The sum of the numbers entered by the user.

    Raises:
        AssertionError: If argument is not an integer.
        AssertionError: If argument is less than 0.


    Examples:
        >>> get_list_sum(7)  # Example (assuming user inputs: 1, 2, -5, 10 , -20 , 30, 5)
