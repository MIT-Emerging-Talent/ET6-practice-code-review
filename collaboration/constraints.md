# Constraints

The group will operate under the following boundaries for the successful
completion of the project.

## External

### Project Deadlines

The project must be completed within the agreed timeframe, with weekly
milestones to track progress. The project has two phases:

- **Documentation phase deadline**: December 30, 2024
- **Code submission deadline**: January 03, 2025
- **Code review deadline**: January 07, 2025

Unforeseen circumstances will be accommodated as needed.

### Technologies

The project will use predefined tools such as:

- **GitHub** for version control
- **Python** for coding
- Additional tools (e.g., **Slack** for communication and **Google Calendar**
for meeting scheduling) to ensure streamlined collaboration.

### Connectivity

Reliable internet access is required for:

- Meetings
- Code sharing
- Communication

Members with intermittent connectivity issues will have asynchronous options for
participation.

### Meeting Schedule

- Meetings will be held at agreed times, typically **bi-weekly**.
- Recorded minutes will be shared for those who cannot attend.
- Flexibility is limited by members' other responsibilities.

### Compliance with CIL and Template

- All documents and code submissions must pass the **Continuous Integration and
Linting (CIL)** checks.
- Submissions must adhere to the provided template to ensure consistency and quality.
- Detailed feedback will be provided for failed checks.

## Internal: Involuntary

### Skill Levels

- Members have varying expertise in coding, testing, and using GitHub.
- **Mentorship or pairing** will be provided to less experienced members to
ensure equitable contribution.

### Time Availability

- Members have different time commitments due to work, education, and family responsibilities.
- Tasks will be divided based on individual availability to ensure fairness.

### Learning Curve

- Some members may need additional time to learn new tools or techniques, such
as advanced Git commands or testing frameworks.
- **Support resources**, such as tutorials and guides, will be shared.

### Personal Obligations

- External responsibilities like exams, work deadlines, or family events may
temporarily limit availability.
- Members are encouraged to **inform the group in advance** to allow for task redistribution.

## Internal: Voluntary

### Coding Style & Conventions

- The group will follow an agreed-upon **coding style guide** for consistency.
- Automated linting tools will be used to enforce these standards.

### Code Review Checklist

- All developed code must pass the required **checklist**.
- Peer reviews will check for:
  - Proper function naming
  - Documentation
  - Test coverage
- Reviews will be completed by **January 07, 2025**.

### Function Assignment

- Each member will prepare at least **two functions** and **two tests**.
- Tasks will be rotated to ensure exposure to different aspects of the project.
- All members will have the opportunity to **review at least one code submission**.

### Testing Requirements

- Members will write **unit tests** for their own functions.
- Peer-review tests written by others.
- Testing coverage will be monitored to ensure completeness.

### Time Commitment

- Members agree to dedicate at least **4–5 hours per week**, with additional
time during critical phases like code integration or final reviews.
- **Time-tracking tools** may be used for accountability.

### Documentation

- Each function must include clear and concise **documentation** with examples
of expected input and output.
- A group-wide **README** file will provide an overview of the project.

### Communication

- **Asynchronous communication tools** like Slack or GitHub Discussions will be
used to accommodate different schedules.
- Urgent matters will be flagged for priority responses.

### Task Prioritization

- Critical tasks will take precedence, with clear deadlines for completion.
- Non-critical tasks will be documented for future consideration if time permits.

### Conflict Resolution

- Disagreements will be resolved through group discussions.
- If consensus cannot be reached, decisions will be made through a **majority vote**.

### Continuous Improvement

- Members will provide **feedback on the process** and suggest improvements
during regular retrospective meetings!
