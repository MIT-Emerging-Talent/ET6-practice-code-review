# Constraints

In any collaborative project, understanding and addressing constraints is essential for success.
A survey was conducted within the group to know the constraint of each member of our group. Below are the internal and external constraint of the group.

## External

<!--
  constraints coming from the outside that your team has no control over:
  - project deadlines
  - number of unit tests required to pass a code review
  - technologies (sometimes a client will tell you what to use)
  - power or connectivity
  - ...
-->

- **Primary Constraint:**
  - Technology limitations (e.g., Git, GitHub, and communication tools) were the most frequently cited
  external constraint, affecting 75% of respondents.
- Time zone differences and internet connectivity are also notable external constraints, each affecting 50% of respondents.
- **Other Concerns:**
  - Project deadlines, inconsistent power supply, and access to a personal computer were mentioned by 25% of respondents each.

## Internal: Involuntary

<!--
  constraints that come from within your team, and you have no control over:
  - each of your individual skill levels
  - amount of time available to work on the project
-->

- **Primary Constraint:**
  - The individual skill levels of group members were cited by 62.5% of respondents, making it the most significant internal constraint.
- **Other notable constraints (each at 37.5%) include:**
  - The amount of time available to work on the project.
  - Individual work schedules.
  - Inability to respond quickly to messages.
- **Least Concern:**
  - The number of hours members want to spend working (12.5%).

## Internal: Voluntary
<!--
  constraints that your team decided on to help scope the project. they may include:
  - coding style & conventions
  - agree on a code review checklist for the project repository
  - the number of hours you want to spend working
  - only using the colors black and white
-->

- **Primary Constraint**:
  - Technology limitations (e.g., Git, GitHub, and communication tools) were the most frequently cited external constraint, affecting 75% of respondents.
- **Time Zone Differences and Connectivity**:
  - Time zone differences and internet connectivity are notable external constraints, each affecting 50% of respondents.
- **Other Concerns**:
  - Project deadlines, inconsistent power supply, and access to a personal computer were mentioned by 25% of respondents each.
