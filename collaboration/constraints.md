# Constraints

Challenges are a natural part of any journey, but they don’t define our
potential or our resolve. Constraints are not setbacks—they are opportunities
to grow stronger, think creatively, and persevere as a team. They remind us of
our resilience and ability to overcome obstacles, no matter how hard they may seem.

As Albert Einstein famously said:
>***In the middle of difficulty lies opportunity***.

Together, we will rise above these challenges and achieve excellence through
determination and teamwork.

## External Constraints

<!--
  constraints coming from the outside that your team has no control over:
  - project deadlines
  - number of unit tests required to pass a code review
  - technologies (sometimes a client will tell you what to use)
  - power or connectivity
  - ...
-->
- Not all group members are available simultaneously due to varying schedules and
circumstances.
- Group members can only commit to short time blocks each day, making it
difficult to hold extended meetings or collaborative sessions.
- The group must balance work on this project with other personal and academic
responsibilities, limiting total available hours.
- The group relies heavily on asynchronous communication due to differences in
availability, which may slow down decision-making process.

## Internal Constraints

<!--
  constraints that come from within your team, and you have no control over:
  - each of your individual skill levels
  - amount of time available to work on the project
-->
- Some group members considered themselves beginners with minimal programming or
technical skills.
- Additional training is required to help group members learn coding and working
with Git and GitHub.

## Individual Constraints

### Ahmed Khalifa

- I work primarily on a phone, making it challenging to work as efficiently as
other group members.
- I face academic constraints as I am currently enrolled in university, which
limits my availability time.

  ---

### Mohammad Al Salloum

- Hard Time management between the university, MIT Emerging Talent
  program, and personal responsibilities.
- I share a single laptop with my brother,
  which makes studying sometimes inconvenient
  due to conflicting times

  ---

### Dadi Ishimwe

- Conflicting times due to personal responsibilities but
  manageable

  ---

### Rama Arafeh

- I feel like I’m falling behind in the group because everything seems
  way over my head without prior experience in GitHub, VS Code, or Python.
- I need significant time to train and learn while balancing my personal
  responsibilities and work.

  ---

### Raed Eleyan

- I don't love Math, so I have to work hard to love it again.

  ---

### Tamara Saqer

- Access to Internet and electricity can be difficult at times,
 which may occasionally impact connectivity and communication.  
- My sense of humor is incredibly advanced and top-tier. Others often find it
  challenging to match, and their memes sometimes fall short of the mark.

### Mukuna Kabeya

- I do not have a pc of my own so coding on a consistent basis is not viable.
- I struggle to manage between my personal life and MIT work,
 but this is manageable.
- My area may experience sudden power cuts due to illegal connections,
  this makes working impossible as power may take days to weeks to return.
