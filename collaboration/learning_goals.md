# Learning Goals

Our learning goals are categorized into two main areas: Focuses on Collective
Goals, that is improving together as a team and Individual Goals helping
individual areas of growth based on the aspirations of each member. This
structured approach guarantees both group development and individual development

## Collective Learning Goals

Together we seek to build a collaborative development environment where we
sharpen our technical and communication skills. Through practice and continuous
learning, we aim to develop a strong foundation in software development and Python
programming. Below are our key focus areas as a collective:

1. Collaborative Development Skills

    - Develop effective collaboration practices through GitHub workflows, including:
        - **Issues**: Creating, tracking, and assigning tasks.
        - **Pull Requests (PRs)**: Submitting, reviewing, and merging pull
        requests to ensure code quality.
        - **Merging**: Understanding different merge strategies and resolving conflicts.
        - **Projects**: Organizing tasks and milestones using GitHub Projects
        for visual tracking.
        - **Branching**: Managing branches effectively to keep the repository
        clean and organized.
        - **GitHub CLI**: Managing repositories, pull requests, and issues from
        the terminal.

2. Effective Communication

    - Enhance communication skills within the team through:
        - **Slack**: Using Slack for group communication.
        - **Regular Meetings**: Actively participating in group meetings and
        discussions to ensure alignment on goals and progress.
        - **Feedback and Collaboration**: Providing and receiving constructive
        feedback in both code reviews and team discussions.

3. Unit Testing

    - Learn and integrate unit testing in Python using the `unittest` module.

4. Code Review Process

    - Develop an understanding of an effective code review process, including
    giving and receiving constructive feedback to improve code quality.

5. Efficient Development Practices

    - Focus on becoming more efficient developers by improving workflows,
    debugging techniques, and programming skills.

6. Python Programming

    - Strengthen Python programming skills by:
        - Writing efficient and well-documented Python code.

7. Docstring Documentation

    - Learning the art of writing clear and concise docstrings to document code effectively.
