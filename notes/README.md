- For the number sort challenge, I uploaded the file via file upload because I
was facing electricity shortage and I had to use my phone to upload the file.
- All the recent updates were done via CLI since the power is partially back and
I have access to a laptop right now.
- The same goes for the other challenges I uploaded via file upload and when I
got my laptop back I updated the files via CLI.
- I updated the functions and test files of some of our team members because
they kept failing the CI checks and this affected all other team members and we
needed to complete our project on time but these issues were keeping us from
commiting any new changes to the repository because they will keep failing the
CI checks.
