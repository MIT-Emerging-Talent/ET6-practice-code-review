## About This Repository 🏄

![alt text](<assets/california-flag 2.gif>)

This repository is part of the MIT Emerging Talent - Foundation Track program.
It is a dedicated space for learning and practicing Python programming,
as well as improving skills in documentation, testing,
and code review to build a strong foundation in software development.
We achieve this culmination through three key milestones:

### 🚀 Project Kick-Off

We began with a clear vision to tackle a range of coding challenges,
communication rules, group norms and project workflow.

### 🧩 Challenges and Solutions

Throughout the project, we developed a variety of Python solutions
addressing challenges in **mathematics, string processing, geometry,
and logical operations**. Each solution is modular, concise,
and rigorously tested for reliability using both _unittests_ and inline _doctests_.

### ✅ Finalization and Project Closure

In the final phase, we ensured all solutions were
thoroughly tested and refined, ready for use and future development.
This phase marked the successful completion of our collaborative effort.

The `solutions/` directory contains all solutions, each targeting a specific problem.

_Unittests_ are located in the `solutions/tests/` folder to ensure accuracy and
robustness, covering a wide range of scenarios, including edge cases.

## Running Tests

To run all available _unittests_, execute the following from the root directory:

```bash
python -m unittest discover -v
```

_Doctests_ are embedded within the scripts and can be run directly in
**Python** for quick checks.
