# Constraints

The group will operate under the following boundaries for the successful completion of the project.

## External

- **Project Deadlines**: The project must be completed within the agreed timeframe, with weekly milestones to track progress. The project has two phases:
  - **Documentation phase deadline**: December 30, 2024
  - **Code submission deadline**: January 03, 2025
  - **Code review deadline**: January 07, 2025
  - Unforeseen circumstances will be accommodated as needed.

- **Technologies**: The project will use predefined tools such as GitHub for version control, Python for coding, and additional tools (e.g., Slack for communication and Google Calendar for meeting scheduling) to ensure streamlined collaboration.

- **Connectivity**: Reliable internet access is required for meetings, code sharing, and communication. Members with intermittent connectivity issues will have asynchronous options for participation.

- **Meeting Schedule**: Meetings will be held at agreed times, typically bi-weekly, with recorded minutes for those who cannot attend. Flexibility is limited by members' other responsibilities.

- **Compliance with CIL and Template**: All documents and code submissions must pass the Continuous Integration and Linting (CIL) checks and adhere to the provided template to ensure consistency and quality. Detailed feedback will be provided for failed checks.

## Internal: Involuntary

- **Skill Levels**: Members have varying expertise in coding, testing, and using GitHub. Mentorship or pairing will be provided to less experienced members to ensure equitable contribution.

- **Time Availability**: Members have different time commitments due to work, education, and family responsibilities. Tasks will be divided based on individual availability to ensure fairness.

- **Learning Curve**: Some members may need additional time to learn new tools or techniques, such as advanced Git commands or testing frameworks. Support resources, such as tutorials and guides, will be shared.

- **Personal Obligations**: External responsibilities like exams, work deadlines, or family events may temporarily limit availability. Members are encouraged to inform the group in advance to allow for task redistribution.

## Internal: Voluntary

- **Coding Style & Conventions**: The group will follow an agreed-upon coding style guide for consistency. Automated linting tools will be used to enforce these standards.

- **Code Review Checklist**: All developed code must pass the required checklist and will be used for peer reviews, including checking for proper function naming, documentation, and test coverage. Reviews will be completed by January 07, 2025.

- **Function Assignment**: Each member will prepare at least two functions and two tests. Tasks will be rotated to ensure exposure to different aspects of the project. All members will have the opportunity to review at least one code submission.

- **Testing Requirements**: Members will write unit tests for their own functions and peer-review tests written by others. Testing coverage will be monitored to ensure completeness.

- **Time Commitment**: Members agree to dedicate at least 4â€“5 hours per week, with additional time during critical phases like code integration or final reviews. Time-tracking tools may be used for accountability.

- **Documentation**: Each function must include clear and concise documentation with examples of expected input and output. A group-wide README file will provide an overview of the project.

- **Communication**: Asynchronous communication tools like Slack or GitHub Discussions will be used to accommodate different schedules. Urgent matters will be flagged for priority responses.

- **Task Prioritization**: Critical tasks will take precedence, with clear deadlines for completion. Non-critical tasks will be documented for future consideration if time permits.

- **Conflict Resolution**: Disagreements will be resolved through group discussions. If consensus cannot be reached, decisions will be made through a majority vote.

- **Continuous Improvement**: Members will provide feedback on the process and suggest improvements during regular retrospective meetings.
