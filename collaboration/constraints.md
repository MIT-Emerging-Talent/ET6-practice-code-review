# Constraints  

This document outlines the constraints for our collaborative project, helping us
focus on realistic goals and effective teamwork. Each member will solve two
problems by writing Python code, documenting it, and testing it. Additionally,
every member will review two problems written by others. The repository is a
group effort, reflecting everyone's contributions.  

## External  

<!--  
  constraints coming from the outside that your team has no control over:  
  - project deadlines  
  - number of unit tests required to pass a code review  
  - technologies (sometimes a client will tell you what to use)  
  - power or connectivity  
  - ...  
-->  

- **Project Deadlines**: The project must be completed by **January 10**, with
internal deadlines for milestones ensuring consistent progress.  
- **Technologies**: The project requires Python, GitHub, VSCode, and linting
tools for coding, collaboration, and quality assurance.  
- **Time Constraints**: Members have limited availability due to full-time jobs
and university schedules.  

## Internal: Involuntary  

<!--  
  constraints that come from within your team, and you have no control over:  
  - each of your individual skill levels  
  - amount of time available to work on the project  
-->  

- **Skill Levels**: The team includes members with a mix of beginner and experienced
skill levels, with most members new to coding.  
- **Time Availability**: Each member can dedicate only a few hours per week due
to other commitments.  

## Internal: Voluntary  

<!--  
  constraints that your team decided on to help scope the project. they may include:  
  - coding style & conventions  
  - agree on a code review checklist for the project repository  
  - the number of hours you want to spend working  
  - only using the colors black and white  
-->  

- **Problem Solving**: Each member will solve two problems by writing Python
code, ensuring the solutions are well-documented and thoroughly tested.  
- **Code Reviews**: Every member will review two problems written by others,
providing constructive feedback to enhance quality and learning.  
- **Coding Conventions**: The team has agreed on consistent coding styles and a
code review checklist to maintain clarity and quality in the repository.  
- **Repository Collaboration**: All members will contribute to a shared GitHub
repository, promoting teamwork and collective ownership of the project.  
- **Scope Management**: Realistic project goals have been set to balance
learning opportunities with completing a high-quality final product.  
- **Tools Commitment**: The team will use GitHub for version control, VSCode for
development, and Python linting tools to ensure clean, efficient code.  
- **Feedback Cycles**: A process for iterative feedback and reviews has been
established to improve both individual skills and project outcomes.
