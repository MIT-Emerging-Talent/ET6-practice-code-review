# Collaboration

Our group is committed to fostering a respectful and supportive environment
where we honor each other's time and cultural differences, while providing
flexible communication channels to accommodate diverse schedules.

## Group Norms

- We will respect each other's time while remaining flexible and understanding
  of unforeseen delays.
- We will create a supportive space that acknowledges cultural differences by
  asking and offering help and encouragement from/to teammates facing any challenges
- We will provide various communication channels whether synchronous or
  asynchronous to accommodate the different availability times of group members.
- We will provide constructive criticism while putting into consideration any
  unforeseen or surprising challenges and refrain from assigning blame.
- If a breach of trust happens, we will evaluate the mistakes that led to the
  breach of trust, learn from them, and implement strategies to prevent similar
  issues in the future.
- We will use discussions to explore ideas and debate to make decisions.
