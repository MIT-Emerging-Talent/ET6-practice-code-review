def remove_triplets(text: str) -> str:
    """
    Removes triplets from string, a triplet is a sequence of three consecutive identical characters.

    This function processes the input string and ensures no three consecutive characters are the
    same by removing the minimum number of characters required.

    Args:
        text (str): The input string to process. It can be empty or contain any characters.

    Returns:
        str: The processed string where no three consecutive characters are the same.

    Raises:
        AssertionError: If the input is not of type string.

    Examples:
        >>> remove_triplets("aaabaaaa")
        'aabaa'

        >>> remove_triplets("helllo")
        'hello'

        >>> remove_triplets("leeetcode")
        'leetcode'

    Edge Cases:
        - If the input is an empty string, return an empty string.
        - If the input has no three consecutive characters, return the input string unchanged.
        - If the input contains more than three consecutive identical
            characters, the function limits the repetitions to two.
