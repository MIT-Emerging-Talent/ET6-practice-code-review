def mirror_words(sentence: str) -> str:
    """
    Reverses each word in a given sentence while maintaining the order of the words.
    Punctuation marks at the end of words are correctly handled, ensuring they remain
    in place.

    Args:
        sentence (str): The sentence to be processed. It can contain words, punctuation,
                         spaces, numbers, and special characters.
    Returns:
        str: A new string where each word is reversed, but the word order, punctuation,
             numbers, and special characters remain unchanged.

    Example:
        >>> mirror_words("Hello world!")
        'olleH dlrow!'

        >>> mirror_words("Python is fun")
        'nohtyP si nuf'

         >>> mirror_words("Keep calm & code on.")
        'peeK mlac & edoc .no'

    Raises:
        TypeError: If the input is not a string.

    Note:
    This function processes each word individually, reversing only the characters
    in the word while leaving punctuation, numbers, and special characters
    unchanged.
