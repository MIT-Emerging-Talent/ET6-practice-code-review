# Retrospective

## Stop Doing

- Skipping regular informal check-ins between scheduled meetings. Introducing occasional touch points could help identify and address potential blockers earlier.
- Assuming that everyone was fully comfortable with the tools and workflows.
- While most team members adapted well, a little extra guidance or troubleshooting sessions could have eased the learning curve for some.

## Continue Doing

- Regular Friday meetings to track progress and provide updates. These were effective in aligning team members and ensuring transparency.
- Using GitHub pull requests for code reviews and collaboration. The process of reviewing changes within 48 hours worked well.
- Maintaining an inclusive and open communication culture where team members feel free to ask for help.

## Start Doing

- Implementing a clearer method for prioritizing tasks to ensure everyone knows the critical priorities for the week.
- Holding occasional training or Q&A sessions to address gaps in technical skills, especially in Git and Python.
- Creating a shared calendar or reminder system to avoid any potential conflicts in availability for meetings or task deadlines.

## Lessons Learned

- **Time Zone Challenges**: The group realized that time zone differences, while manageable, required better planning for synchronous communication.
- **Skill Gaps**: Variations in team members' proficiency with tools highlighted the need for tailored support to help everyone contribute effectively.
- **Flexibility and Adaptability**: The team showed great adaptability in overcoming technology limitations and communication barriers.
However, this can be improved further by having contingency plans for unexpected constraints.

## Strategy vs. Board

### What parts of your plan went as expected?

 The team successfully conducted weekly meetings, reviewed pull requests on time, and collaborated effectively on Slack.

### What parts of your plan did not work out?

The reliance on Slack or GitHub only for resolving complex issues sometimes caused delays. More face-to-face virtual calls could have streamlined problem-solving.

### Did you need to add things that weren't in your strategy?

- Introduce a weekly summary of constraints and priorities to keep everyone updated.
- Create clearer guidelines for documenting issues and resolutions in GitHub.

### Or remove extra steps?

- Reduce redundant follow-ups in Slack by consolidating updates during meetings.
