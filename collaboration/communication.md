## Asking for Help

There's a fine line between confidently learning from your mistakes, and
stubbornly getting no where. Here is a general guide for when to ask for help
based on how long you've been stuck on the same problem:

1. _0 -> 30 min_: Try on your own
1. _30 -> 60 min_: Ask your group for help
1. _60+ min_: Tag your coaches in Slack or GitHub

## Additional notes

- All team abide by the **group norms** at all times
- Please document everything so everyone can understand
- Communicate at all times  
- Always ask **why** don't just do
