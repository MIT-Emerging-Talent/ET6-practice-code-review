# Retrospective  

This document represents the retrospective for our Team Project, created by
Group 12. Below, you will find individual retrospectives
from each team member, reflecting on their experiences,
lessons learned, and areas for improvement.  

The structure and plan for this retrospective were initially proposed to us as
a guide to help each participant conduct their own reflection. While this
structure is not mandatory, it was created to assist in organizing thoughts in
a consistent and professional manner. You can review the suggested structure
below, which we followed to provide clarity and coherence in our reflections.

## Retrospective Structure

### Key Reflection Topics

- Stop Doing  
- Continue Doing  
- Start Doing  
- Lessons Learned  

### Strategy vs. Board - Key Questions for Reflection

- What parts of your plan went as expected?  
- What parts of your plan did not work out?  
- Did you need to add things that weren't in your strategy?  
- Or remove extra steps?  

By following this structured approach, we aimed to capture valuable insights
from each participant while maintaining a professional and organized
presentation of our reflections. This document not only serves as a
summary of our achievements and challenges but also as a foundation
for improving our workflows and collaboration in future projects.

## What I will stop doing  

Honestly, there‚Äôs nothing that I feel I need to stop doing. I‚Äôve been intentional
about my approach to this project, and it‚Äôs been going great. For example, my
structured Git workflow, regular communication with the team, and consistent contributions
to reviews have all been effective. I‚Äôve also learned the importance of balancing
quality and efficiency, and these efforts are paying off.  

## What I will continue doing

- **Collaborative Reviews:** I‚Äôve been actively reviewing my teammates‚Äô work and
offering constructive feedback, and I will continue doing this because it improves
the overall quality of our code.  
- **Clear Git Workflow:** I‚Äôve been following a structured Git workflow by creating
branches, committing regularly, and writing detailed pull requests. I will stick
to this because it‚Äôs been very effective.  
- **Team Support:** I‚Äôve been fostering open discussions and supporting my teammates,
and I will keep doing this because it helps us work better as a team.  

## What I will start doing  

- **Regular Check-ins:** I plan in future projects to suggest having more frequent
check-ins with the team to stay aligned and track our progress more effectively.
- **Automated Testing:** I want to start incorporating more automated testing into
my workflow to catch potential errors early and ensure our code is reliable.  

## The lessons that I have learned  

- **Importance of Communication:** I‚Äôve learned how crucial it is to communicate
effectively with my team. Misunderstandings can lead to delays, so I now focus on
being clear and concise.  
- **Value of Feedback:** I‚Äôve realized how valuable it is to receive and give constructive
feedback during code reviews. It‚Äôs helped me grow and write better code.  
- **Patience with Learning:** I‚Äôve also learned that it‚Äôs okay to take time to fully
understand new tools or techniques instead of rushing through them.

## The parts of my plan that went as expected

I found that my structured Git workflow and clear communication for pull requests
worked as I had planned. These practices helped me stay organized and complete tasks
efficiently.  

## The parts of my plan that did not work out  

There wasn‚Äôt anything that didn‚Äôt work out in the overall sense. The general track
of the project went exactly the way I planned it. Although the process involved
trying things out, and some of these didn‚Äôt work, that was all part of the learning
experience. Each trial added to my understanding and contributed to the success of
the project.

## Things that I added that weren't in my initial strategy  

I had to include more detailed documentation for my work after realizing it
might not be clear enough for my teammates during reviews.

# Retrospective - Zephaniah Okoye

## What I will refrain from doing

- **Delaying Communication**: Avoid waiting too
   long before seeking help or clarifying doubts.
- **Ignoring Time Management**: Stop neglecting the
   importance of a structured schedule.
- **Working in Isolation**: Avoid working on tasks
   without collaborating with teammates.

## What I will keep doing

- **Collaborative Efforts**: Maintain active
  participation in team discussions and code reviews.
- **Structured Workflow**: Continue following a clear
   Git workflow and maintaining organized commit histories.
- **Proactive Communication**: Keep communicating progress
   and challenges regularly with the team.

## What I will commence doing

  leading to timely completion of tasks and high-quality output.
- **Code Reviews**: Constructive feedback during code
  reviews significantly improved the code quality.
- **Communication**: Regular and clear communication helped in
   resolving issues quickly and maintaining progress.
- **Seeking Help**: My ability to ask for help from teammates both
   privately and on the Slack general communication platform was a lifesaver.

## What could have been improved

- **Time Management**: More structured scheduling could have
   helped in meeting deadlines more efficiently.
- **Early Testing**: Integrating automated testing earlier in
  the development process could have caught potential issues sooner.
- **Documentation**: More detailed documentation from the beginning
   would have provided better clarity for team members.

## Lessons gleaned from my experience

## Stop doing  

-Since I am new to github, and I followed all the instructions given to  us,
I do not feel there is anything for me to stop doing.
I ensured I communicated with my team on problems I encounter,
and they are always responsive.  

## Continue doing

- **Effective Communication:** I have been communicating with my team
effectively. Anything, I do not understand, I ask questions directly
on the group.

- **Mid-Sprint Check-Ins:** I learnt a lot from the meetings on mondays where
we discuss progress and blockers. Like Insights tab on github, I did not notice
this tab until during the meeting.

- **Thorough Testing:** I did thorough testing of code before I deploy
on github.

- **Open Communication:** I enjoyed how open our communication is
on how to solve our problems on github.

- **Naming Convention:** I noticed how my reviewer improved my naming.
convention for clarity. Therefore, I will put more attention to how I will
name my variables for better understanding.

- **Control Version:** I will continue to make use of git and github,
because this effectively track changes.

- **Performance Optimization:** I like the way we have checklist to mark
  during the review stage. This is to ensure the person writing the code has
  done all necessary things to ensure the task is 100% complete.

## Start doing  

- **Automated Testing:** I want to start implementing automated
  testing to reduce manual effort such as the way we did unit test
  on the functions before deployment of our calculator project.

- **Project Mangement Tools:** I believe it is better to use project
management tools like github to manage our project. This ensure better
tracking making everyone work on their own time within a given deadline.

- **Post-Deployment Report** I will like to try out writing out post-deployment
reports to analyze feature such as a new function or a new update to evaluate
what went wrong, the challenges during the software development stage.

## Lessons Learned  

- **Quality Over Speed:** In my team, we focused on choosing a simpler code
for our project so that we could have more time understanding the code, git,
vs code and github platform.
- **Effective Communication:** Effective communication is key within our team.
We communicated both on github, slack and the docs sent to us. We had less
misunderstandings amongst ourselves as we are all focused on getting the work
done.
- **Adaptability:** I have learnt to be adaptable as this crucial. This is first
time I will be working with people I have not met before and our project was a success.
Being flexible with our timeline helps the team succeed.

- **Documentation Matters:** It helps provide clear explanation of how things work,
which makes it easier for onboarding and troubleshooting.

## The part of my plan that went as expected

I relied on studying what we were taught in class and collaborating
with the group members. And this went well, as they did wonders in helping me
understand the group project.

## My Plan that did not work out

I underestimated the time required for debugging especially when I want
to push my code to github and it is requesting me to merge. I actually expected
to just push my code after changing and the unexpected keep resisting me.

## Things that I included that weren't in my initial strategy  

I had to my add some things in my code during the review that were not part of
my initial strategy. Like the edge cases in my add-function.
