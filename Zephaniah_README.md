# MIT Emergent Talent Foundation Track Assignment - Group 12 ![logo](.assets/logo.png)

Welcome to the repository for **Group 12**'s assignment
 as part of the MIT Emerging Talent
Foundation Track. This repository represents our collaborative effort to explore,
 learn, and apply essential skills in software development through the
  implementation of a **calculator project**. Each member of the team is
   contributing unique functionalities to the calculator,
    reviewing each other’s code, and refining the project as a group.

## Project Overview

This repository serves as the final deliverable for
the Foundation Track, showcasing our teamwork and
dedication to mastering foundational concepts in
software development. Our primary objective is to
collaboratively design and develop a calculator, with every team member
contributing to its various
functionalities. As a team of **10 emerging talents**, we are working together to:

- Implement different features of the **calculator project**,
 including basic arithmetic, advanced functions, and more.
- Collaborate on code reviews to ensure high quality and maintainability.
- Utilize **Git** for version control and collaboration.
- Navigate and manage projects effectively on **GitHub** using issues,
 pull requests, and project boards.
- Adhere to **test-driven development (TDD)** cycles
to ensure robust and reliable code.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Version Control**: Git, integrated with GitHub
- **Editor**: Visual Studio Code (VS Code) with extensions to enhance productivity
- **Collaboration**: GitHub issues, pull requests, and project boards

## About Group 12

We are a motivated and enthusiastic group of learners,
collaborating as contributors to this shared
repository. This assignment is more than an assessment requirement

each other, ensuring that no one is left behind.
- **Accountability**: Taking ownership of our tasks and responsibilities,
and holding each other accountable to meet our commitments.
- **Fun**: Enjoying the process of learning and building together,
 and celebrating our achievements as a team.

## Project Structure

The calculator project is structured to ensure modularity and ease of collaboration.
 Key elements include:

- **Feature Modules**: Each team member is responsible
for implementing specific features,
 such as addition, subtraction,
or other advanced scientific functions.
- **Testing**: A dedicated test suite ensures all functionalities
 work as intended, following TDD principles.
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation
accompanies the code to ensure clarity and usability.
