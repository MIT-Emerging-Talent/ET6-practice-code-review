def lowestCommonAncestor(root: "TreeNode", p: "TreeNode", q: "TreeNode") -> "TreeNode":
    r"""
    Finds the Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) of two nodes in a Binary Search Tree.

    In a Binary Search Tree, the Lowest Common Ancestor between two nodes p and q is the lowest node
    such that both p and q are descendants of this node (a node can be a descendant of itself).

    Args:
        root (TreeNode): The root node of the Binary Search Tree.
        p (TreeNode): The first node in the tree.
        q (TreeNode): The second node in the tree.

    Returns:
        TreeNode: The Lowest Common Ancestor of nodes p and q.

    Notes:
        - If both p and q are smaller than the current node, the LCA is in the left subtree.
        - If both p and q are larger than the current node, the LCA is in the right subtree.
        - Otherwise, the current node is the LCA.

    Examples:
        Example 1:
            Input: root = [5,3,8,1,4,7,9,null,2], p = TreeNode(3), q = TreeNode(8)
            Output: TreeNode(5)

        Example 2:
            Input: root = [5,3,8,1,4,7,9,null,2], p = TreeNode(3), q = TreeNode(4)
            Output: TreeNode(3)
