# ⚙️ Project Boundaries & Constraints

## 🚧 Clear Boundaries for Efficiency

To ensure efficiency and balanced contributions,the project should have
clear boundaries.

Roles and responsibilities should be well-defined to prevent
overlapping efforts.

Expectations should be set for balanced contributions, considering
members' constraints.

A culture of constructive feedback and solution-focused discussions
should be established.

A clear process for resolving conflicts is essential.

These boundaries aim to create a productive and supportive
environment for the team

## 🌍 External Constraints

their progress:'''

new skills
required, is a challenge to the team members.
