# Retrospective

## Stop Doing

- Delaying the start of the project, which led to initial confusion.  
- Spending unnecessary time on excessive documentation steps.  
- Relying solely on self-research for troubleshooting GitHub Actions errors.

## Continue Doing

- Fostering a collaborative and supportive team environment.  
- Holding regular meetings and maintaining open communication.  
- Conducting daily stand-ups for alignment and clarity on tasks.  
- Providing constructive and detailed feedback during code reviews.  
- Sharing knowledge and mentorship opportunities within the team.

## Start Doing

- Establishing clearer timelines and assigning roles more explicitly.  
- Creating a knowledge base repository for best practices, troubleshooting
  guides, and FAQs.  
- Using a shared calendar or scheduling tool to streamline meetings.  
- Scheduling weekly retrospectives to review progress and identify roadblocks.  
- Proactively discussing roadblocks and potential solutions during meetings.

## Lessons Learned

- Team collaboration and mutual support significantly contribute to project
  success.  
- Early project initiation helps the team gain momentum and avoid delays.  
- Maintaining flexibility and using asynchronous communication can resolve
  scheduling conflicts.  
- GitHub workflows and CI/CD checks are critical components that require
  attention and troubleshooting.
