# Notes

## Calculator Project To-Do List  

### Step 1: Repository Setup  

- [ ] Clone the repository to your local machine.  
- [ ] Open the repository in VS Code.  
- [ ] Create a personal branch in the repository named after your assigned challenge.
- [ ] Create an issue for the assigned functions in the repository to track
progress and discussions.

### Step 2: Function Implementation  

- [ ] Choose two functions from the available list.  
- [ ] Create a file named `your_function.py` inside the `solutions` folder in the
repository.
- [ ] Document the selected functions in the your_function.py file.  
- [ ] Implement the logic for your assigned functions in the calculator.  

### Step 3: Writing Docstrings

- [ ] Write detailed docstrings for each function.  
- [ ] Include a brief description, parameters, and return type in the docstring
for each function.  

### Step 4: Writing Unit Tests  

- [ ] Create a separate file for unit tests inside the `tests` folder,
named `test_your_function.py`.  
- [ ] Write unit tests for each of your implemented functions.  
- [ ] Ensure the unit tests cover a variety of cases, including edge cases.  

### Step 5: Committing Changes  

- [ ] Stage your changes in Git.  
- [ ] Write a clear and descriptive commit message for your changes.  
- [ ] Push your changes to your personal branch on GitHub.  
- [ ] Create a pull request for it to be merged into the main branch.  
- [ ] Write `closes #issue_number` (to link your pull request to the issue you
created for this function).

### Step 6: Collaboration  

- [ ] Review the pull requests of other team members.  
- [ ] Test the functionality of other implemented functions as part of the
review process.  
- [ ] Provide constructive feedback and resolve any conflicts in the code.  

### Step 7: Finalizing  

- [ ] Merge your reviewed function branch into the main branch once approved.
