"""
A module for performing bubble sort on an array.

Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list,
compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The
pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted.

Module contents:
    - bubble_sort(arr): Sorts an array in ascending order using the bubble sort algorithm.

def bubble_sort(arr: list[float | int]) -> None:
    """
    Sorts a list of elements in ascending order using the bubble sort algorithm.

    Parameters:
        arr: list, A list of comparable elements (integers, floats, etc.).

    Returns:
        None: The function sorts the list in place, and does not return a new list.

    Raises:
        AssertionError: If the input is not a list or if the list contains
        elements that are not comparable.

    Example:
        >>> arr = [5, 2, 9, 1, 5, 6]
        >>> bubble_sort(arr)
        >>> arr
        [1, 2, 5, 5, 6, 9]

        >>> arr2 = [12, 11, 13, 5, 6]
        >>> bubble_sort(arr2)
        >>> arr2
        [5, 6, 11, 12, 13]

        >>> arr3 = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2]
        >>> bubble_sort(arr3)
        >>> arr3
        [1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9]

    Time Complexity:
        Best case: O(n) when the list is already sorted (optimized with the is_swaped flag).
        Worst case: O(n^2) when the list is sorted in reverse order.

    Space Complexity:
        O(1) because the sorting is done in place and no additional memory is required.
